# Random Forecasts

Random forecasts help create a baseline against which we can compare our forecasts. They help us answer the question **Is our forecast any better than taking a random guess?**

  * Randomly forecast a customer.
  * Randomly forecast a product.
  * Random forecast of binary prediction. For example - Will it rain any time over the next 15 days?
